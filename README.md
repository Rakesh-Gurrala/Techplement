Front End Developer Task : I create a dashboard for the weather app. The App Is Built Using : HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a Bootstrap framework and communicates with the Rapid API backend to provide real-time weather updates to users.
HTML : html defines the structure of your content.
CSS : CSS determines the style and layout.
JavaScript : JavaScript makes the content interactive.
example : This document describes a weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions in       different cities. The app uses the Rapid API weather data source to retrieve temperature, date, month, time, city and other weather details for where the user enters a city name and clicks search to display the weather conditions.
